## Overview
### Description
Fashion blogging app created for users to post, buy, and sell different fashion/designer pieces at their own leisure as well as connecting with other users within the app creating groups and having conversations about fashion ideas, upcoming relaeases, etc.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Fashion/social networking 
- **Mobile:** this app will be primarily developed for mobile use. Functionality will be limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:**  Users will be able to post pictures of their outfits, shoes, or own personal brands. They will also be able to add tags over pieces of clothing or shoes, therefore, when clicking on the items it will show any information provided by the user such as: Brand, Name of shoe or clothing item, link to purchase, etc. Users will also be able to follow each other & create joinable or invitational groups based upon similar interests such as: streetwear, formal wear, aesthetic, sneakers, dress shoes, etc.
- **Market:** any individual could use this app, but to keep it a safe environment there will be an age restriction.
- **Habit:** this app could be used as often as the user wants depending on how much they shop and are browsing for new fashion items. 
- **Scope:** First we would start with the different clothing categories based on taste in clothing and/or brands, then perhaps this could filter or narrow down the items the user is in search of, but also giving the users a chance to broaden their usage with all of the items and options given. Large potential use with ASOS, Fashion Nova, and other fashion/ clothing applications.
